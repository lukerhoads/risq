# Game design

## Traditional

The traditional game was designed, taking into consideration the confidence a studier has when testing themselves.

Being a student myself, I find it disconcerting when I find myself confident in a concept that I am fundamentally incorrect about. Being confident about the wrong thing is not great.

But, like anything, being able to acknowledge that you do not know, that there is room to improve - this is key to taking accountability and studying effectively.

By adding a betting feature, the confidence of studiers is being tested. If they are confident about the wrong answer, there will be setbacks. But if they acknowledge that they do not know the answer, they can still achieve a good score.

## AI Sentences

The AI sentences game design was designed with the idea that the more connections a studier can make with the word/term, the better they will be able to recall it. Our brain stores memories by making connections to other memories. By having studiers craft sentences with the term, it is forcing them to think of a broader context and potentially make some connections with the term that will enable them to better recall it.

This experience is designed to mimic the experience of writing or note-taking. These activities promote more connections to be made with the content being studied. This is what I aimed to achieve through the new possiblilities of large language models.
